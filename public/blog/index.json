        "body": "I\u0026rsquo;m always interested in the music that\u0026rsquo;s the best to come out in any given year, but this often contrasts heavily with my actual listening habits. This is why I look to Last.fm for my top listened to albums of the year.\n Flume - Hi This Is Flume Flying Lotus - Flamagra Denzel Curry - Zuu Weval - The Weight Vorna - Sateet palata saavat Sensible Soccers - Aurora Behemoth - I Loved You At Your Darkest Borknagar - True North Yagya - Stormur James Blake - Assume Form  For reference, my albums of the year 2019.\n\u0026hellip; and ironically, this might be the first year where the two lists actually coincide quite well! Every release here is from 2019, except Behemoth\u0026rsquo;s latest, which is from late 2018 and which I discovered in 2019. Needless to say, each of these releases is worth a listen as well!\n"

        "body": "It\u0026rsquo;s the time of year where I talk about way more than anyone is willing to care about\u0026hellip; the ALBUM OF THE YEAR.\nI keep track all year, every year, and 2019 has been no different. Like 2018, it\u0026rsquo;s been a year without any huge instant classics, but lots of good quality in lots of different genres. I had an easy time picking 20 contestants for this list, but a very hard time arranging them and making the final cut.\nSo without any further unnecessary talking, here is the list!\n Leprous - Pitfalls Borknagar - True North Denzel Curry - ZUU James Blake - Assume Form Lisa Morgenstern - Chameleon Wilderun - Veil of Imagination Flume - Hi This is Flume Cult of Luna - A Dawn to Fear The Chemical Brothers - No Geography Vorna - Sateet palata saavat  I would love to hear your opinion, and anything I might have missed.\nThat being said, I usually have some honorable mentions as well. But\u0026hellip;\n Lisa Morgenstern already claims \u0026ldquo;best new artist\u0026rdquo; Vorna already claims \u0026ldquo;best non-English album\u0026rdquo;  So here are some of the albums that really impressed me, but just didn\u0026rsquo;t make the cut (no particular order):\n Yagya - Stormur (minimal techno) The Comet is Coming - Trust in the Lifeforce of the Deep Mystery (fusion/psychedelic jazz rock) Yugen Blakrok - Anima Mysterum (hip hop/trip hop)  "
