      <description>How long had I walked? I cannot say with precision. But many hours had passed since I was last able to see more than a hundred yards, through trees so dense that sometimes I could not even see the river I followed. Part of me was glad to be able to walk again, and breathe the air of the forest.

      <description>Hooray! This post marks the start of my blogging adventure on my brand new, self created website.
This blog is going to be about all kinds of things. Whatever I feel like writing about, honestly, but there will be some major themes: web development, music, and just some personal thoughts about&amp;hellip; well, not sure about what yet! I may also fill up an archive of blogposts from my previous site. But for now, please have a look around and let me know if you like it!</description>
