      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m always interested in the music that&amp;rsquo;s the best to come out in any given year, but this often contrasts heavily with my actual listening habits. This is why I look to Last.fm for my top listened to albums of the year.
 Flume - Hi This Is Flume Flying Lotus - Flamagra Denzel Curry - Zuu Weval - The Weight Vorna - Sateet palata saavat Sensible Soccers - Aurora Behemoth - I Loved You At Your Darkest Borknagar - True North Yagya - Stormur James Blake - Assume Form  For reference, my albums of the year 2019.</description>

      <description>Along with my album of the year, the last few years I have been posting about my top songs of the year as well. Well, I&amp;rsquo;ll stop talking because these songs speak for themselves!
Note that they are sorted for listenability more than for any actual order.
You can also find this list as a playlist on Spotify!

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s the time of year where I talk about way more than anyone is willing to care about&amp;hellip; the ALBUM OF THE YEAR.
I keep track all year, every year, and 2019 has been no different. Like 2018, it&amp;rsquo;s been a year without any huge instant classics, but lots of good quality in lots of different genres. I had an easy time picking 20 contestants for this list, but a very hard time arranging them and making the final cut.</description>
