layout: "playlist"
draft: false
headline: Bonkers tunes and tunes about bonkers
subtitle: This is my soundtrack for crazy days, when songs about satan's ice cream truck make more sense than real life.
sidenote: This is a cross genre playlist. But it can't be truly bonkers without some good metal and jazz in there, so soft ears beware!
