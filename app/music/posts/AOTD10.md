I don't think I ever put this much effort into making a list. The past decade I have listened to music in near obsessive quantities, and so there were tons of records to go through and evaluate. I could have picked them from memory, but I wanted to take the time and give all candidates another good listen. This actually kicked some albums significantly higher up the list, and as a consequence, some others went down or even off the list entirely (I'm sorry Dillinger Escape Plan).
