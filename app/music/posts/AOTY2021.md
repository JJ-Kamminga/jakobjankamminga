2021 Brought me a variety of reasons, some personal, some less so, _not_ to write new blog posts. In fact, my website has received no updates whatsoever since last January. It does not receive a lot of traffic usually, so if you were expecting something, my apologies. I was even contemplating skipping my usual year end's lists for a moment. Musically, 2021 was not that interesting to me. Despite some interesting finds, after my top 6 albums it quickly gets into OK-ish territory. I've discovered a lot of fun records, notably including two Dutch acts Goldband and Altin GÃ¼n, but nothing that really blew my socks off. Forcefully narrowing it down to 10, I arrive at the following list.

1. Kunzite - VISUALS
2. Wardruna - Kvitravn
3. Converge & Chelsea Wolfe - Bloodmoon I
4. Aesop Rock & Blockhead - Garbology
5. The Lazy Eyes - EP2
6. La Femme - Paradigmes
7. Floating Points & Pharoah Sanders - Promises
8. Mastodon - Hushed and Grim
9. Sebastian Plano - Save Me Not
10. Nubiyan Twist - Freedom Fables
