As usual, accompanying [my albums of the year 2024](../posts/AOTY2024/), these are my most listened albums of the year.

Among some of this year's favourites, are a few gems I missed from 2023! For example, heading the list by some margin is the best so far on record of Yussef Dayes, a drummer and bandleader who brings a high level of technical skill alongside a great talent for soothing and emotionally deep composition.

Ihsahn is notable for being the only metal album high on the list. This is no coincidence, this "self titled" album is possible his best so far, keeping his standards in intensity and complexity, but providing a strong melodic backbone through thoughtfully integrated orchestral support.

Hip hop was also well represented in my music tastes this year, coming in at 3 positions in this top 10 alone. Joey Valence & Brae did this with NO HANDS by breaking down the wall of what is expected from the genre and really being themselves. The two albums closing out the list by CRIMEAPPLE/Preservation and Blockhead are more subtle, presenting more suave and clever takes on the genre that will likely be great listens for decades to come.
