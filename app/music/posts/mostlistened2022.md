As usual, accompanying [my albums of the year 2022](../posts/AOTY2022/), these are my most listened albums of the year. This year brought a lot more good music to my taste, and I'm not surprised to see many of this year's albums back in the list.

The list:

1. Denzel Curry - Melt My Eyez See Your Future
2. Modeselektor - Extended
3. Ibibio Sound Machine - Electricity
4. King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard - Omnium Gatherum
5. Black Thought & Danger Mouse - Cheat Codes
6. Moderat - MORE D4TA
7. Amorphis - Halo
8. Kendrick Lamar - Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers
9. Kunzite - Visuals
10. Rammstein - Zeit
11. Tycho - Back to Mine
12. Honningbarna - Animorphs
13. Sea Power - Everything Was Forever

This list was extended from the usual ten spots, because numbers eight through thirteen were only five plays apart.
