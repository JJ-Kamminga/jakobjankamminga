> Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood. Let the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood.

I collected these songs based on their wild, ritualistic energy. It is playlist of sounds across ambient, folk, rock and electronic that breathe the free air of meadows and mountains. It's quite different from my usual, but as I collected these songs over the past two years, it's grown to be one of my favourites.
