As usual, accompanying [my albums of the year 2023](../posts/AOTY2023/), these are my most listened albums of the year. Many of my favourites this year were suitable for playing on repeat, and it is no surprise to find them here. Notable high rankers that I didn't include in my best albums list are Flavien Berger and Gabriels - who released very strong albums, but simply had stronger competition.

Destroyer notably features as the only album not from this year, a late discovery of 2022.

1. Kelela - Raven
2. Flavien Berger - Dans Cent Ans
3. Christine and the Queens - PARANO√èA, ANGELS, TRUE LOVE
4. Destroyer - Labyrinthitis
5. The Free Music - Free Music, part 1 (Habibi Funk 021)
6. Gabriels - Angels & Queens
7. Katatonia - Sky Void of Stars
8. Alfa Mist - Variables
9. Puma Blue - Holy Waters
10. King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard - PetroDragonic Apocalypse; or, Dawn of Eternal Night: An Annihilation of Planet Earth and the Beginning of Merciless Damnation
