As usual, accompanying [my albums of the year 2025](../posts/AOTY2025/), these are my most listened albums of the year. I get this data from Last.fm, feel free to check out [my profile](https://www.last.fm/user/andnino).

A lot of my favourites from this year also got played on repeat, which results in two similar lists! **L'Eclair** takes the spotlight here, just not making it into the albums of the year list, with a record that is absolutely incredible to play on repeat.

1. L'Eclair - Cloud Drifter
2. Turnstile - Never Enough
3. The Weeknd - Hurry Up Tomorrow
4. FKA Twigs - EUSEXUA
5. Ela Minus - DÍA
6. Domenique Dumont - Deux Paradis
7. Juno Francis - Melancholia
8. Amaia - Si Abro Los Ojos No Es Real
9. I Häxa - I Häxa
10. DARKSIDE - Nothing
