Willpower, *volition*, or the related concept of discipline, is a concept that deserves more attention in the current day and age, but some scrutiny as well.

Willpower is a trait we employ to act in accordance to our own will. It is not a trait to do just whatever we, or others want. Doing what others want is subservience, a concept that perhaps deserves its own thought.

At first glance, we may position willpower against laziness, reluctance or indifference. I do not think that is fair. Reluctance to do what others want can be natural and reasonable, particularly when it contradicts what *we* want.

The world we live in puts extreme efforts towards capturing our attention, convincing us of what we should want, and what we should value. It can be hard to see what it is that we want, versus what others want of us.

Similarly, we are often put into positions where we do not get to choose what we do. We may be pushed or obliged to do certain things for work, family or social norms. We may not have a choice. This is what makes life hard, and it is natural to feel overwhelmed, or indifferent to the needs of others.

How, then, can we excercise our will? We do not have to quit our job, cut ties, or go into full protest - though sometimes we must. Willpower is to have reached into ourselves, know what we want, and steer in that direction in the areas that we have influence over. It may be small, it may be slow, but when we act out of our own motivation, it can give us just that bit of control we need to sustain us through difficult times.
