I write as catharsis. I put to paper what I need to say. I rarely look back. When I do, I see a past version of myself. I recognise myself partially at best. When I have no urgency to write, there is an active resistance in me to do so.

I have been asked whether I have an interest in writing as a profession. I don't really, because I only write well enough to be happy with when there is this catharthic drive. This is usually caused by a pain or problem that I see and feel in the world, and where I see a potentially valuable contribution from myself.

If I was just reading, writing and talking, I would not sustain these conditions. I need to participate in the world to know what I want to say.
