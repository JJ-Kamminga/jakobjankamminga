Coming out of a blogging slumber, I simply cannot skip posting a list with my favourite albums of the year. In particular because there were many new albums that I liked particularly well. It's also the first year (if memory serves) where the same band appears twice on the list, and in first and second place no less!

<!-- Early 2023, I saw KGLW live for the first time, kickstarting a listening binge of their entire discography. Despite (re)discovering some greats from their long list of releases, PetroDragonic Apocalypse  -->

1. King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard - PetroDragonic Apocalypse; or, Dawn of Eternal Night: An Annihilation of Planet Earth and the Beginning of Merciless Damnation
2. King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard - The Silver Cord
3. Gorillaz - Cracker Island
4. Kelela - Raven
