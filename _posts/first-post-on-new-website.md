Hooray! This post marks the start of my blogging adventure on my brand new, self created website.
This blog is going to be about all kinds of things. Whatever I feel like writing about, honestly, but there will be some major themes: web development, music, and just some personal thoughts about... well, not sure about what yet! I may also fill up an archive of blogposts from my previous site. But for now, please have a look around and let me know if you like it!
